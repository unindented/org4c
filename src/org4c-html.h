 * HTML header/footer manually before/after calling org_html().
 *
 * Params input and input_size specify the Org input.
 * Callback process_output() gets called with chunks of HTML output.
 * (Typical implementation may just output the bytes to a file or append to
 * some buffer).
 * Param userdata is just propagated back to process_output() callback.
 * Param parser_flags are flags from org4c.h propagated to org_parse().
 * (ORG_FLAG_SKIPCOMMENTED and ORG_FLAG_SKIPNOEXPORT are always added, as the
 * commented subtrees and the ones tagged "noexport" are never rendered.)
 * Param renderer_flags is bitmask of ORG_HTML_FLAG_xxxx.
 *
 * Returns -1 on error (if org_parse() fails.)
 * Returns 0 on success.
